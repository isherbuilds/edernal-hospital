## Picking the right models for workflows and subagents

Rankings, higher = better. Cost reflects what I actually pay (OpenAI has really generous limits), not list price. Intelligence is how hard a problem you can hand the model unsupervised. Taste covers UI/UX, code quality, API design, and copy-

| model    | cost | intelligence | taste |
| -------- | ---- | ------------ | ----- |
| gpt-5.5  | 9    | 8            | 5     |
| sonnet-5 | 5    | 5            | 7     |
| opus-4.8 | 4    | 7            | 8     |
| fable-5  | 2    | 9            | 9     |

How to apply:

- These are defaults, not limits. You have standing permission to override them: if a cheaper model's output doesn't meet the bar, rerun or redo the work with a smarter model without asking. Judge the output, not the price tag. Escalating costs less than shipping mediocre work.
- Cost is a tie-breaker only; when axes conflict for anything that ships, intelligence > taste › cost.
- Bulk/mechanical work (clear-spec implementation, data analysis, migrations): gpt-5.5 - it's effectively free.
- Anything user-facing (UI, copy, API design) needs taste ≥ 7.
- Reviews of plans/implementations: fable-5 or opus-4.8, optionally gpt-5.5 as an extra independent perspective.
- Never use Haiku.
- Give each subagent a clear goal, the relevant context, and what to bring back. Don't have them invent the plan. Run independent pieces in parallel.

When they return, review the results before you merge anything. If something's off, rewrite the brief and spin another, don't silently patch over it yourself unless it's trivial.

This repository uses [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) as the canonical agent instruction file.

Claude should read and follow `AGENTS.md` before making changes in this repo. Keep repo-specific instructions there so all agents share one source of truth.
